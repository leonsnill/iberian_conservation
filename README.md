Assessing suitable habitat for the Iberian brown bear (Ursus arctos) and Lynx (Lync pardinus) populations on the Iberian Peninsula. 
---------------
### Prioritization analysis
*Results*
* dispersal_vague_noPA: those areas that will likely be colonised under a low-pressure dispersal scenario (25% anthropogenic cover range) and adjacent or close to protected areas (under 50 Km buffer). 
* low_colonize:  those areas colonised by the large carnivores on the low-pressure dispersal scenario, but not on the restrictive dispersal scenario (2.5% anthropogenic cover range).
* poly_disp_restrictive: shapefile with restrictive dispersal scenario (2.5%). 
* poly_disp_vague: shapefile with the low dispersal scenario (25 %).
