## Abstract
### Aim
Large carnivores are currently recolonizing their historical ranges in Europe after centuries of persecution and habitat loss. Understanding the mechanisms driving these recolonisations is important for proactive conservation planning to foster coexistence between carnivores and people. Using the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) as examples, we explore where and when large carnivores are likely to expand into human-dominated landscapes, and how varying levels of human pressure in landscapes might impact this recolonisation process.
### Location
Iberian Peninsula
### Methods
We used ensembles of species distribution models to relate species occurrence data to climate, topography and satellite-based land-cover predictors at a 10-km spatial resolution. Resulting predictions of suitable habitat areas were fed into a dispersal model to simulate range expansion over the 10 time steps for different human pressure scenarios. Finally, we overlaid predictions with protected areas to highlight areas that are likely key for future connectivity, but where human pressures might hamper dispersal.
### Results
We found widespread suitable habitat for both species (30,000km2 and 170,000km2 for bear and lynx, respectively), yet anthropogenic barriers limit the potential range expansion of both species. For brown bears, core habitats between the Cantabrian and Pyrenean populations remained unconnected despite suitable habitat. For lynx, we predicted higher range expansion potential, although high human pressures in southern coastal Spain negatively affected existing populations.
### Main conclusions
Our results highlight that the recolonisation potential of brown bears and lynx in the Iberian Peninsula is likely more constrained by human pressure in landscapes than by habitat availability, a situation likely emblematic for large carnivores in many parts of the world. More generally, our approach provides a simple tool for conservation planners and managers to identify where range expansion is likely to occur, and thus where human-carnivore conflicts could arise, to proactively implement preventive measures that foster coexistence between humans and wildlife.
