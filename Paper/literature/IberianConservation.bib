abstract = {The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) may be the first charismatic felid to become extinct in a high-income country, despite decades of study and much data that show extinction is highly probable. The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes it as critically endangered; about 200 free-ranging individuals remain in two populations in southern Spain. Conservation measures aimed at averting extirpation have been extensively undertaken with 4 of the former 10 Iberian lynx populations recorded 25 years ago. Two of the four populations have been extirpated. The number of individuals in the third population have declined by 83{\%}, and in the fourth the probability of extirpation has increased from 34{\%} to 95{\%}. Major drivers of the pending extinction are the small areas to which conservation measures have been applied; lack of incorporation of evidence-based conservation, scientific monitoring, and adaptive management into conservation efforts; a lack of continuity in recovery efforts, and distrust by conservation agencies of scientific information. In contrast to situations in which conservation and economic objectives conflict, in the case of the Iberian lynx all stakeholders desire the species to be conserved. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {The conservation or creation of ecological corridors is a key to support species persistence in fragmented landscapes. However, little guidance exists on where to concentrate the restoration measures to improve corridor quality and functionality. Focusing on the emblematic Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus as the target species, and using a resistance surface parameterized through detailed telemetry data for the species, we applied a modeling approach that identifies corridors whose restoration would be more beneficial for enhancing landscape connectivity. Connectivity benefits were quantified, first, as the increase in the Probability of Connectivity metric (dPC) that results for the entire population network after reducing the effective distance along a particular corridor to its minimum possible value through restoration, and second, as dPC normalized by a proxy of the total restoration effort that would be required in each corridor. Results showed that the corridor restoration benefits were related to their effective distance (accumulated cost of movement along the corridor) and network centrality (potential frequency of use by dispersing individuals) in the current landscapes. Two corridors in which restoration efforts may be more desirable for the Iberian lynx were highlighted: the one linking the Do{\~{n}}ana-Aljarafe population with other populations and reintroduction areas further north, and a west-east axis connecting the different populations in Sierra Morena. In general, the applied approach is a valuable tool to estimate how landscape connectivity may be affected when changes in the landscape are planned or can be predicted. This approach can be applied to potential corridors linking future reintroduction areas of the Iberian lynx, to case studies focusing on other landscapes and animal species, or to evaluate the impacts of corridor degradation or loss due to land use changes and other pressures.},

abstract = {The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) has suffered severe population declines in the twentieth century and is now on the brink of extinction. Climate change could further threaten the survival of the species, but its forecast effects are being neglected in recovery plans. Quantitative estimates of extinction risk under climate change have so far mostly relied on inferences from correlative projections of species' habitat shifts. Here we use ecological niche models coupled to metapopulation simulations with source-sink dynamics to directly investigate the combined effects of climate change, prey availability and management intervention on the persistence of the Iberian lynx. Our approach is unique in that it explicitly models dynamic bi-trophic species interactions in a climate change setting. We show that anticipated climate change will rapidly and severely decrease lynx abundance and probably lead to its extinction in the wild within 50 years, even with strong global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In stark contrast, we also show that a carefully planned reintroduction programme, accounting for the effects of climate change, prey abundance and habitat connectivity, could avert extinction of the lynx this century. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, why considering prey availability, climate change and their interaction in models is important when designing policies to prevent future biodiversity loss. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Conservation biology faces the challenge of ensuring species persistence in increasingly modified landscapes. Agriculture covers a large proportion of the Earth's surface, but the degree to which crop production is compatible with species use of the landscape is still uncertain, particularly for woodland carnivores with large territories. Here, we focus on the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, an emblematic endangered species that has coexisted for centuries with human-modified Mediterranean mosaics, as a case study to unravel habitat and dispersal preferences in heterogeneous landscapes. We estimated species resource selection from ≈40 000 telemetry locations for 48 GPS-collared individuals covering all the current Iberian lynx range, including more fragmented areas where the species was reintroduced from 2009. We differentiated GPS locations within home ranges (to estimate habitat suitability) and those corresponding to dispersal or exploratory movements (to estimate landscape permeability). We built mixed conditional logistic regression models with 12 land cover classes, terrain slope and roads as predictors. We found that lynx response to agriculture largely depends on the crop type and on the presence of natural vegetation remnants. Lynx largely avoided intensive cultivation areas such as irrigated arable lands when establishing home ranges, but frequently selected permanent crops (olive groves) and/or heterogeneous agricultural lands, which were used with smaller differences to the most preferred shrubland or forest covers than reported in previous studies. Such differences further narrowed down when lynx moved outside home ranges, with some agricultural covers being as permeable as shrublands for lynx dispersal. The species dispersal plasticity was also evidenced by a much weaker avoidance of roads and steep terrain when dispersing than when selecting territories. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that (i) the widespread consideration of all agricultural lands within a single (and usually regarded as unsuitable) class for the study and management of woodland or forest species is not supported and that (ii) the ability of woodland species to use fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes may have been underestimated, which may mislead conservation measures due to a priori assumptions that do not relate to the actual species responses to heterogeneous land covers. We suggest that Iberian lynx conservation and reintroduction may be successful in a wider set of more heterogeneous areas than previously thought, including mainly well-conserved Mediterranean woodlands but also some extensive agricultural lands with permanent crops and natural vegetation remnants.},

abstract = {Habitat selection models for woodland species usually consider forest attributes derived from land cover maps, such as an area covered by forests or distance to forest edge, but canopy cover is less frequently used as a predictor. We evaluated the effect of including forest canopy cover data in habitat selection models for woodland species using the endangered Iberian lynx as a case study. We considered four canopy cover classes for both conifer and broadleaved forests, together with other land cover predictors, and analyzed a large telemetry (GPS-GSM collars) dataset. The model that included forest canopy cover outperformed, both in predictive power and in conservation management insights, the model that only used forest area. The effect of forest canopy cover on lynx habitat selection was especially strong for broadleaved forests; an increased tree cover in these forests consistently translated into significantly lower selection probabilities. Open broadleaved forests were found to clearly be the most preferred habitat. By contrast, the habitat model without canopy cover data indicated that broadleaved forests were significantly less preferred than shrublands and mountain olive groves, which may mislead conservation management actions. We conclude that habitat selection models for woodland species should consider forest canopy cover as a relevant candidate predictor as it can capture important factors influencing habitat use, such as understory vegetation abundance or prey availability. Recent developments on remote sensing technologies will increase the availability of spatially continuous information on canopy cover, facilitating a more widespread use of vegetation structural variables in habitat modeling and hence improving the conservation planning value of these models.},
